## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project applies k-means clustering to well log data for lithology labeling, using the open-source FORCE 2020 dataset. The main objective is to assess the effectiveness of unsupervised machine learning methods for classifying lithologies based on well log data. The dataset includes various well logs (gamma ray, density, resistivity, neutron porosity, and photoelectric factor) collected from 118 wells.

The analysis is split into three major parts: data preprocessing and splitting, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and clustering. The workflow is structured across three Jupyter Notebooks, ensuring reproducibility and consistency in the analysis. The final output includes comprehensive visualizations and cluster comparisons with geological age groups and lithology labels.


## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To get a copy of this project up and running, you will need to clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

### Prerequisites

To get a copy of this project up and running, you will need to clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

- Python 3.x

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

This project performs k-means clustering on well log data. Use the provided notebooks to explore and analyze the FORCE 2020 dataset, and generate clustering results. The visualizations include crossplots, histograms, KDE plots, and well log composite plots that compare well logs, lithology labels, and clustering results.


## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

This project is intended to be run in a local Jupyter environment. For deployment on cloud systems or servers, additional setup (like Docker or cloud-based Jupyter environments) may be required.
